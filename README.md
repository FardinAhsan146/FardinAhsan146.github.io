# Fardin Ahsan - About me 

I'm a self-taught data scientist who is passionate about building better predictive models of The World.  I spend a significant portion of my free time reading up on Statistics and programming pet projects using Python. 

I use Pythons datascience stack (Pandas,NumPy,Sk-learn and PyTorch) for all EDA, visualization and modelling.

## Do I know how to write a fizz-buzz script? 

```python
'''
Yes. Branchless programming not necessary
'''
for i in range(1,16):
    print('fizz'*(i % 3 == 0)+'buzz'*(i % 5 == 0)+str(i)*(i % 3 != 0 and  i % 5 != 0))
```

## Publications 

I worked on four different research projects on Machine Learning applications during my undergraduate degree. The results from two of the papers are currently published, the remaining two are a work in progress, that I am currently working on having graduated. 

* #### [A Water Behavior Dataset for an Image-Based Drowning Solution](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9618700)
	* **Collaboration**
	* **Technical Summary**: Pose Estimation, Video Classification 
	* **General Summary**: Dataset of swimming activity behaviors tested using various Pose Estimation and Video classification models. 
	* Published in [2021 IEEE Green Energy and Smart Systems Conference (IGESSC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9618669/proceeding)
* #### [Predicting License Plate Prices using Machine and Deep Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9915267) 
	* **First Author, Collaboration**
	* **Technical Summary**: Regression modelling 
	* **General Summary**: Predicting Dubai License Plate listed prices using webscraped data from various local eccommerce websites. Modelled prices as a time series to tackle a Regression problem.
	* Published in the [2022 International Conference on ICT for Smart Society (ICISS)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9915021/proceeding)
* #### [Predicting Illicit Bitcoin Transactions using GAT techniques](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Crypto-ML)
	* **First Author, Collaboration**
	* **Technical Summary**: Classification modelling, Representation Learning, Graph Attention Networks
	* **General Summary**: Using Graph Attention Network to learn node features of directed temporal graphs. Models trained on the Elliptic Dataset. Aiming to achieve highest recall score for illicit class. 
	* Planning to publish in March 2023. If you want to collaborate reach out to me through email. 
* #### Prevent-a-bot, classifying sexual predators in online chats 
	* **Collaboration**
	* **Technical Summary**: NLP Classification, Representation Learning, GPT-Dialo-Large based chatbot,  Chatbot application back-end
	* **General Summary**: Created a classifier to detect sexual predators, trained on the PAN-12 dataset. A GPT-Dialo-Large based chatbot was tuned to pretend to be a child. The two parts are tied together using an SQLite database. 
	* In the process of being published in IEEE Access
	
* #### Investigating studentsâ€™ preferred camera settings on Zoom for optimal learning experiences across different interaction scenarios in online learning
	* **Collaboration**
	* **Technical Summary**: Discrete Clustering, Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA
	* **General Summary**: Used statistical techniques to indentify different groups of students based on their camera usage (theirs and instructors). Students were stratified based on gender and academic achievement levels. 
	* Under review for publication in the Journal of Computer Assisted Learning


## Projects

All my personal projects can be found in my Github. Here are a few. 

* #### [Dubai Housing Price Regression](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/DubaiHousingPriceDS)
	* **Technical Summary**: Regression modelling, Algorithms 
	* **Story**: I combined 5 different datasets to predict Housing prices in Dubai based on the features of the housing unit itself and its surrounding venues and transit options. I had to write an algorithm that uses GPS coordinates to assign venues to specific neighborhoods based on their polygon outlines.  

* #### [Red Scare Text Analysis](https://github.com/f3zinker/RedScare-Analysis) 
	* **Technical Summary**: Time series hypothesis testing, Text analysis, Language API's   
	* **Story**: I carried out text analysis to figure out if the discourse quality in a subreddit got worse over time. 
	
* #### [Optimal number of circuit components](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Resistor-approximate)
	* Collaboration with [Michael Jurasovic](https://jurasofish.github.io). 
	* **Technical Summary**: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, Optimization
	* **Story**: Gives you the smallest number of electronic components (resistors, capacitors, inductors) from a given list; to achieve the required unit specification within a tolerance band. I created this project to help out fellow EE students for their EE labs so they don't have to think about how many components they need in which amount.

* #### [Distances between locations script](https://github.com/FardinAhsan146/Spreadsheet-of-distances-google-maps)
	* **Technical Summary**: Scripting, Webscraping, Multi-threading 
	* **Story**: I saw my dad wasting time manually plugging in distances of locations between two columns in an excel sheet. I wrote a script that does that work for him. 

### Hobby Writing

I like writing non-academic non-fiction texts. However, I don't have the free time to write as much as I would like to. Ultimately I might make a Substack one day.
